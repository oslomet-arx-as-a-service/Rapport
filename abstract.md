# Abstract

Companies all over the world are increasingly feeling the demand for privacy protections of user data.
At the same time demand for data science and ML shows no sign of slowing down. One strategy to solve this tension is data anonymization.
Data anonymization is a large field with many projects worldwide contributing worldwide. But the field has been largely dominated by medical research.
The tooling currently leading the pack is not well suited for modern day data driven enterprise.

ARXaaS, or ARX-as-a-Service is bachelor thesis project completed by a group of students from OsloMet on behalf of NAV IT.
The project aims to provide access to best-in-class anonymization features from the well renowned ARX project in a package better suited for data driven development.

ARXaaS re-packages the core ARX libraries as a data anonymization micro-service. Dockerized and easily deployable on platforms as Kubernetes,
and with a client package written in Python for easy interaction.
