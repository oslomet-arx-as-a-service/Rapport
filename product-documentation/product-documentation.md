Logging:

ARXaaS has logging implemented using log4j. For every data set that is analyzed and anonymized. The application provides metrics for received and completed requests. The log displays the size of the dataset, number of rows and columns, source IP, dataset bytesize, privacy model used, suppression limit and request processing time.
